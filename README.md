### A Browsing App for [NASA API Data](https://api.nasa.gov/) (APOD and Mars Rover Images)

The open NASA API has a lot of great data offerings for image browsing, and I wanted to build this simple app for those who enjoy browsing images all about space. The APOD (astronomy picture of the day) tab shows daily facts on both astronomical objects and photography. The Mars Rover tab works with images snapped by some of NASA's rovers roaming the planet to give perspective of its surface. I'm a big fan of NASA, so I chose this API to practice with this project.

Please feel free to mention any improvements or bugs you may find. :)
